# Trollface Me Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)

## Purpose

Extension made for self-develpment / tesing the hobby.

## What it does

Prank your entourage, drive them crazy by displaying a troll from time to time during their web browsing on the Chrome Web Browser.

# Project configuration

Global Configuration (i.e. being out of the dist/src/test folders) comes from the following TypeScript React boilerplate using the Rollup module bundler:
https://github.com/extend-chrome/ts-react-boilerplate
https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/

And the boilerplate used comes mostly from:
https://github.com/llagerlof/fresh-chrome-extension

It was not fully configured and used for the moment in this project since I dont use typescript or react framework
